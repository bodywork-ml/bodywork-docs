# Version 1.0.0

## Add Support for Ingress

We added the `INGRESS` configuration parameter to the `[service]` section of a stage's `config.ini` file. This is a mandatory configuration parameter that must be set to either `True` or `False`. If an [NGINX ingress controller](../kubernetes.md#configuring-ingress) has been installed in the cluster and if `INGRESS=True`, then a path from the external IP of the ingress controller, to the service, will be created automatically when the service is created. This enables services to receive requests from sources external to the cluster, via URLs of the form `http://INGRESS_CONTROLLER_EXTERNAL_UP/NAMESPACE/SERVICE_NAME`.

## Enable Remote Workflow Executions on an ad hoc Basis

Workflows can now be executed via remote workflow-controller jobs, on an ad hoc basis, using the `bodywork deployment create` command. Prior to this release, the only way to trigger a workflow that is managed as a job on a cluster, was via the `bodywork cronjob create` command - ad hoc workflows could could only be executed by having the workflow-controller run locally, using the `bodywork workflow` command.

## Other Improvements and Bug Fixes

- We improved exception handling around internal git commands, so that users now get informative logs when git encounters problems cloning project repositories.
- We changed the working directory in which stages are run, to the directory containing the executable Python module for the stage. This makes it much easier to reference other files (e.g. trained models and other such artefacts), that may have be included with the other mandatory stage files.
