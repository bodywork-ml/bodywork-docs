# Version 2.0.0

## Move to a Single YAML Configuration File

We have moved **all** Bodywork project configuration to a single [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format configuration files, called `bodywork.yaml`. This must exists in the root directory of your project - see [here](https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-pipeline-project/blob/master/bodywork.yaml) for an example `bodywork.yaml` file.

This means that the old `config.ini` files (required for each stage), together with the old `bodywork.ini` file (for the workflow), are no longer required. All of the configuration that was held in these files, is now to be placed in `bodywork.yaml`. We appreciated that this is a major change, but we have found that generating `bodywork.yaml`, when starting from the old configuration files, only takes a few minutes, as the parameter names have remained the same as they were before.

## Enable Validation of Configuration via the CLI

We have introduced a new CLI command,

```shell
$ bodywork validate
```

That will validate the configuration data contained within the `bodywork.yaml` file and report validation errors to the terminal. See the [CLI Reference](cli_reference.md#validate-configuration-file) for more information

## Bodywork Containers Upgraded to Python 3.8

The pre-built [Bodywork containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/bodyworkml/bodywork-core), used to run executable Python modules that form Bodywork project stages, will now be running Python version 3.8.8. Therefore, all projects that intend to use Bodywork for deployment, will need to be compatible with Python version 3.8.8.

## Other Improvement and Bug Fixes

- The `executable_script` configuration parameter required for each stage, has been replaced by `executable_module_path`. This now enables stages to be defined by executable Python modules located **anywhere** within a project - i.e., there is no longer a constraint to have the executable module for a stage, located in a fixed directory that defines the stage and its name.
