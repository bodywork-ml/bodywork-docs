# Version 2.1.0

## Support for Git repositories hosted on GitLab, Azure DevOps and BitBucket

We now support public and private repositories hosted on [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com), [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/), as well as [GitHub](https://github.com)!

!!! warning "Working with private repositories"
    We have renamed the secrets that need to be created for working with private Git repositories - please refer to the [User Guide](../user_guide.md#working-with-private-git-repositories-using-ssh) for more information.

## Git commit hash exposed as an environment variable in every Bodywork Container

The Git commit hash of a project can be accessed from within any Bodywork container, via the `GIT_COMMIT_HASH` environment variable. This allows you to tag any artefacts produced by your pipelines, such as datasets and trained models, with the precise version of the pipeline used to create them. For example,

```python
import os

git_hash = os.getenv('GIT_COMMIT_HASH')
model_filename = f'my-classifier--pipeline={git_hash}.pkl'
save_model(model, model_filename)
```

## Other Improvements and Bug Fixes

- We've upgraded to the latest version of the [Kubernetes Python client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python), which supports Kubernetes v1.17.17.
- We've introduced an alias for the `bodywork workflow` [command](../user_guide.md#testing-workflows-locally). For consistency, `bodywork deployment create ... --local-workflow-cotroller` will run a deployment with the workflow-controller running locally for testing.
- We've introduced the `bodywork deployment delete-job` [command](../cli_reference.md#delete-deployment-jobs), for cleaning-up completed workflow-controller jobs. Not all clusters are configured to clean-up these jobs up automatically, in which case you may have to delete them manually.
